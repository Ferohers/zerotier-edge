#
# This is a default rule set that allows IPv4 and IPv6 traffic but otherwise
# behaves like a standard Ethernet switch.
#
# Please keep in mind that ZeroTier versions prior to 1.2.0 do NOT support advanced
# network rules.
#
# Since both senders and receivers enforce rules, you will get the following
# behavior in a network with both old and new versions:
#
# (old: 1.1.14 and older, new: 1.2.0 and newer)
#
# old <--> old: No rules are honored.
# old <--> new: Rules work but are only enforced by new side. Tags will NOT work, and
#               capabilities will only work if assigned to the new side.
# new <--> new: Full rules engine support including tags and capabilities.
#
# We recommend upgrading all your devices to 1.2.0 as soon as convenient. Version
# 1.2.0 also includes a significantly improved software update mechanism that is
# turned on by default on Mac and Windows. (Linux and mobile are typically kept up
# to date using package/app management.)
#

#
# Allow only IPv4, IPv4 ARP, and IPv6 Ethernet frames.

# Uncomment to drop non-ZeroTier issued and managed IP addresses.
#
# This prevents IP spoofing but also blocks manual IP management at the OS level and
# bridging unless special rules to exempt certain hosts or traffic are added before
# this rule.
